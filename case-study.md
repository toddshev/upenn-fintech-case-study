# Case Study on Personal Capital

## Overview and Origin
---
* Firm's name: Personal Capital, an Empower company

* The firm was founded in 2009, and purchased by Empower Retirement in June of 2020.  It was founded by Bill Harris, Rob Foregger, Paul Bergholm, and Louie Gasparini.  The most prominent is Mr. Harris, who was formerly the CEO of Intuit, PayPal, and PassMark Security.  He received his MBA from Harvard University.

* I chose this company as it is focused on the individual, rather than many other companies in this industry that are corporate-focused, or linking corporations to individuals.  I am also working on a startup which is similar in nature to this company, so this case study is both interesting and helpful.

* The company was originally funded at $265.3M with 12 investors, then was recently purchased for $1B by Empower, which was at a premium to the firm's valuation.

## Business Activities
---
Many individuals have their assets scattered in different places, and don't have a holistic view of what they have, where the gaps are, and do not have a roadmap to plan their future.  They also have the same problem on the other side of the balance sheet (liabilities), and do not understand the correlation between the two.

Virtually any individual is the target market.  Ideally the individual should have investable assets, income, and the ability to save a portion of their income.  For example the firm provides a free consultation if you link at least $100k in investable assets.  They should also have basic technical skills, internet access, and a fundamental understanding of money.

There are surprisingly few competitors directly in this space, as many people rely on financial advisors, or simply choose to forego analysis as it is time-consuming and fragmented.  There is an abundance of asset management companies, and financial advisors, but those focused on providing clients with detailed analysis of all of their assets are still coming into view.  Several of the competitors, such as Mint, provide some of this information, but their focus is more transactional.  Providing needed visual tools and scenario analysis still has room for growth.

## Technologies Used
---

## Landscape
---
The primary domain is Personal Finance, though there are aspects of robo advising (as well as personal advising and asset management).  The ultimate goal of the firm is to convert assets linked to assets under management.

### Trends
 Portfolio adjustments and automated investing have increased dramatically in the past decade.  What started as direct deposit now includes automatic savings into retirement plans, as well as features such as rebalancing and tax loss harvesting.  Online trading has become cheaper and more accessible to more people. The rise of ETFs, which are now outperforming mutual funds, has also reduced costs and given investors more control over their portfolios. With online trading becoming ubiquitous and more players entering the market such as Questrade and Virtual Brokers, larger banks have been forced to reduce their fees to stay competitive.

New investment opportunities in the alternative markets have given consumers more options on where to allocate their capital.  Companies like Lending Club now offer peer to peer lending, and typically provide much better returns than traditional cash and bond securities, let them adjust risk to be appropriate for their tolerance, and absorb low fees due to disintermediation.  

Cryptocurrencies, utilizing blockchain technology, also offer individuals and investors the ability to invest and transact in non-regulated currencies, that are very secure and can result in very high returns depending on market conditions.  

Fee-for-service financial planning has also become more popular.  Rather than paying a percent of assets for around-the-clock financial advice, many individuals are paying to have specific questions answered and specific tasks performed.  This may eventually be replaced or heavily augmented by robo-advisors.

What are the other major companies in this domain?  This firm crosses domains, but some of the major players are  Mint.com, SoFi, Lending Club, Funding Circle, OakNorth (Europe), Addepar, and Advizr.  Larger established financial firms also have their own versions of robo-advising, and historical RIA advisors have become commoditized at this point, indicating robo-advising will increase in market share in future years.

## Results/Business Impact
---
Regarding the firm, it is highly profitable, and has surprisingly high fees for the clients who invest assets with them.  They charge close to the Registered Investment Advisor average of 1% of assets, but due to the large average account balance of $440k, they generate approximately $75M in revenues, with relatively low operating costs. 

The impact of this company to the consumer is ultimately efficiency of personal financial information, which is difficult to quantify. Individuals can now manage their money better, allocate their resources more efficiently, save money on fees, expenses, and taxes which results in a higher propensity to consume, which increases overall spending output leading to economic growth.  It has likely hurt financial advisors who are no longer essential when the consumer has the information directly available to them.  

All companies rely on KPI's to determine their performance.  The primary metrics/KPI's in the case of Personal Capital are pretty straightforward:
 - Number of subscribers (listed as 2.6M), which are ultimately leads in the sales funnel
 - Number of investment clients (listed as 24,500), which is the primary revenue source.  As a subset of this the sizable average account balance increases revenue per client
 - The culmination of the KPI's mentioned above is Assets Under Management (AUM), which is currently listed as $14B.  While this is relatively small in the financial services arena, it shows exceptional growth for a small company.

* Though the industry has some cross-over, Personal Capital is considered to be the most profitable firm in its space.  It is a personal financial management tool and robo-advisor, though it also has personal advisors, as well as asset management.  With a lot of competitors in different areas in which they participate, it is difficult to say they are the best, though they are definitely a major player and growth potential is virtually unlimited.  They are much more nimble than traditional asset managers, and have adequate resources to continue investing in technology.

## Recommendations
---
While they appear to have a strong leadership team and a powerful yet easily-accessible product, they should focus on the two strategies all financial services firms should: Broaden product offerings, and global expansion. These types of firms make money based on scale, and using their existing technologies, they are positioned to be a market leader in this area.

There are many approaches they could take to broaden their offerings.  These include, but are not limited to, the following:
- Offer alternative investments - such as partnering with Lending Club to give clients a better way to store cash or IRA funds.
- Allow self-directed IRA's which have the ability to invest directly in real estate, art work, rare coins, currencies, marijuana, and other non-traditional assets.  
- They could even offer clients a way to invest in startups, Reg-D's, and participate directly in other operational businesses.

 * Now with blockchain, crypto-currencies, and other companies that can provide international money transfers and currency translations, they should make their products and services available to all 7 billion people inhabiting the planet.  There may be legal considerations for certain aspects (API's connecting to foreign banks; SEC, FINRA, IFRS regulations, privacy laws (like GDPR and CCPA) and other legislation; etc.), but certainly some of their offerings can be provided globally.     

* The aforementioned will benefit the firm by obtaining more subscribers, more assets under management, and help the global economy by providing overall improvements to personal financial efficiency on a global scale.  Offering more products and services increases "stickiness" in a crowded market, and would reduce lost clients and those splitting funds between entities which would increase share of wallet.  There could also be more revenue opportunities such as charging fees for these additional services, or on currency exchanges.

* There are many technologies required for this growth strategy.  Blockchain and cryptocurrencies would likely be part of the solution, as well as utilizing Forex and very strong security with funds crossing international boundaries.  Other technologies, some of which are less defined, are regulation technology, specifically for working with foreign markets, and API's for connecting to partners [such as Lending Club, or self-directed partnerships with other banks (i.e. - Equity Trust Company)]. 

* These technologies are important because currencies fluctuate against each other daily, and ensuring reasonable exchange rates would be a necessity.  Blockchain will be needed for validation as well as the rail for the asset transfers.  Any type of security breach would be catastrophic, especially between international borders.  As this is an asset management company, clients don't want to jump around between sites, so API's and connections will provide a more seamless integration and user experience for the clients.
