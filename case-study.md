# Case Study on Personal Capital - Assigned Sep 15th

## Overview and Origin

* Personal Capital, an Empower company

* When was the company incorporated? - it was founded in 2009, and purchased by Empower Retirement in June of 2020.

* Who are the founders of the company? Founded by Bill Harris, who was formerly the CEO of Intuit, PayPal, and PassMark Security.  He received his MBA from Harvard University.  Other founders are Rob Foregger, Paul Bergholm, and Louie Gasparini.

* I chose this company as it is focused on the individual, rather than many other companies in this industry that are corporate-focused, or linking corporations to individuals.  I am also working on a startup which is similar in nature to this company, so this market research will be helpful.

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?  It was originally funded at $265.3M with 12 investors, then was recently purchased for $1B by Empower.


## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve? - Many individuals have their assets scattered in different places, and don't have a holistic view of what they have, where the gaps are, and do not have a roadmap to plan their future.  They also have the same problem on the other side of the balance sheet (liabilities), and do not understand the correlation between the two.

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Virtually any individual is the target market.  Ideally the individual should have investable assets, income, and the ability to save a portion of their income.  For example the firm provides a free consultation if you link at least $100k in investable assets.  They should also have basic technical skills, internet access, and a fundamental understanding of money.  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?).  There are surprisingly few competitors in this space, as many people rely on financial advisors, or simply choose to forego analysis as it is time-consuming and fragmented.  Several of the competitors, such as Mint, provide some of this information, but their focus is more transactional.  Providing needed visual tools and scenario analysis still has room for growth.

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

* The firm uses a slew of technologies, including:
	Javascript/Jquery/plugins - for efficient and visually appealing client-side development
	Node.js - for full stack connectivity with the server side
	Java - reliable and stable server-side processing	
	Bootstrap - a CSS template used for style and ux design
	Google Cloud Platform
	NGINX - Load Balancing and Security
	C++
	Moment.js
	Google Analytics/Optimizely - for visitor and site tracking
	DevOps - RequireJS

Additional Tools:
	WordPress (blog)
	G Suite
	Zendesk
	AdRoll
	Medium

## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in? The primary domain is Personal Finance, though there are aspects of robo advising (as well as personal advising).

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years? Portfolio adjustments and automated investing have increased dramatically.  What started as direct deposit now includes automatic savings into retirement plans, as well as features such as rebalancing and tax loss harvesting.  Online trading has become cheaper and more accessible to more people. The rise of ETFs, which are now outperforming mutual funds, has also reduced costs and given investors more control over their portfolios. With online trading becoming ubiquitous and more players entering the market such as Questrade and Virtual Brokers, larger banks have been forced to reduce their fees to stay competitive.

* New investment opportunities in the alternative markets have given consumers more options on where to allocate their capital.  Companies like Lending Club now offer peer to peer lending, and typically provide much better returns than traditional cash and bond securities, let them adjust risk to be appropriate for their tolerance, and absorb low fees due to disintermediation.  

* Cryptocurrencies, utilizing blockchain technology, also offer individuals and investors the ability to invest and transact in non-regulated currencies, that are very secure, and can result in very high returns depending on market conditions.  

* Fee-for-service financial planning has also become more popular.  RAther than paying a percent of assets for around-the-clock financial advice, many individuals are paying to have specific questions answered and specific tasks performed.  This may eventually be replaced or heavily augmented by robo-advisors.

* What are the other major companies in this domain?  Mint.com, SoFi, Lending Club, Funding Circle, OakNorth (Europe), Addepar, Advizr, and with any luck, Handstand (my startup).


## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far? Regarding the firm, it is highly profitable, and has surprisingly high fees for the clients who invest assets with them.  They charge close to the Registered Investment Advisor average of 1% of assets, but due to the large average account balance of $440k, they generate approximately $75M in revenues, with relatively low operating costs.  
* The impact of this company is ultimately efficiency of personal financial information, which is difficult to quantify. Individuals can now manage their money better, allocate their resources more efficiently, save money on fees, expenses, and taxes which results in a higher propensity to consume, which increases overall spending output leading to economic growth.  It has likely hurt financial advisors who are less needed when the consumer has the information directly available to them.  

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?  The primary metrics/KPI's are pretty straightforward - number of subscribers, recently listed on their website as 2.6 million, Number of investment clients, listed as 24,500, and assets under management, also listed on their website as $14B.  There are also "add-on" services like financial advice that they would like to maximize.

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?


## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!).  While it looks like they have a strong leadership team, a great and easily-accessible product, they should focus on the two strategies all financial services firms should: Broaden product offerings, and global expansion. These types of firms make money based on scale, and using their existing technologies, they are positioned to be a market leader in this area.
* There are many approaches they could take to broaden their offerings.  Offer alternative investments - such as partnering with lending club to give clients a better way to store cash or IRA funds, allow self-directed IRA's which have the ability to invest directly in real estate, art work, rare coins, currencies, and other non-traditional assets.  They could even offer clients a way to invest in startups, Reg-D's, and participate directly in other operational businesses.
 * Now with blockchain, crypto-currencies, and other companies that can provide International money transfers and currency translations, they should make their products and services available to all 7 billion people inhabiting the planet.  There may be legal considerations for certain aspects (API's connecting to foreign banks; SEC, FINRA, IFRS regulations and other legislation; etc.), but certainly some of their offerings can be provided globally.     

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?  More subscribers, more assets under management, overall improvements to personal financial efficiency on a global scale.  Offering more products and services increases "stickiness" in a crowded market, and would reduce lost clients and those splitting funds between entities.  There could also be more revenue opportunities such as charging fees for these additional services, or on currency exchanges.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?  There are many considerations, though blockchain and cryptocurrencies would likely be part of the solution, as well as utilizing Forex, as well as ensuring the best possible cybersecurity.

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?  Currencies fluctuate against each other daily, and ensuring reasonable exchange rates would be a necessity.  Blockchain will be needed for validation as well as the rail for the asset transfers.  Any type of security breach would be catastrophic, especially between International borders.

#### 4. Write the case study.

Write the finished case study report in a markdown `README.md` file, using the above case study template. Your report should be sufficiently long to ensure you provide all relevant information about the company or project in a thorough manner.

Be sure to cite your sources in an addendum at the end of the report. List all websites, podcasts, blogs, or articles that you consulted in order to write the report, and provide links. Your list should be thorough and account for all sources you used, but it does not need to be a formal works cited page.
